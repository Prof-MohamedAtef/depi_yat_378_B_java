1. Write a Java program to add two matrices of the same size.
2. Write a Java program to multiply two matrices. Assume the first matrix's column size equals the second matrix's row size.
3. Write a Java program to find the transpose of a given matrix.
4. Write a Java program to find the maximum element in a two-dimensional array.
5. Write a Java program to calculate the sum of each row and column of a 2D array.
6. Write a Java program to check if a square matrix is symmetric (equal to its transpose).
7. Write a Java program to find the sum of the main diagonal elements of a square
8. Write a Java program to find the saddle point of a matrix. A saddle point is an element which is the minimum in its row and maximum in its column.
