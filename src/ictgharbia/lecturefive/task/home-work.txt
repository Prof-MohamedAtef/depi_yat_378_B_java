1. What is the primary difference between static variables and instance variables in terms of memory allocation?
2. Explain what happens to a static variable when the class it belongs to is loaded into memory.
3. Why canâ€™t a static method directly access instance variables?
4.  What is the output of the following code?
class Counter {
    static int count = 0;
    Counter() { count++; }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter c1 = new Counter();
        Counter c2 = new Counter();
        System.out.println(Counter.count);
    }
}

5. Why are constants typically declared as both final and static?
